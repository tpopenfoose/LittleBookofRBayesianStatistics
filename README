This book uses the Sphinx Documentation system (sphinx-doc.org).

To build your own copy of the book run:

  sphinx-build . raw

in the LittleBookofRBayesianStatistics directory, which contains conf.py

This will build html output, and place it in outdir.

To build the latex version:
 
  sphinx-build -b latex . raw   

and to convert the .tex file to pdf:
  cd raw    
  pdflatex BayesianStatistics.tex
