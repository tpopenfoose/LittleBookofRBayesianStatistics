Using R for Bayesian Statistics
===============================

Bayesian Statistics
-------------------

This booklet tells you how to use the R statistical software to carry out some simple 
analyses using Bayesian statistics.

This booklet assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of Bayesian statistics, and
the principal focus of the booklet is not to explain Bayesian statistics, but rather 
to explain how to carry out these analyses using R.

If you are new to Bayesian statistics, and want to learn more about any of the concepts
presented here, I would highly recommend the Open University book 
"Bayesian Statistics" (product code M249/04), available from
from `the Open University Shop <http://www.ouw.co.uk/store/>`_.

There is a pdf version of this booklet available at
`https://github.com/avrilcoghlan/LittleBookofRBayesianStatistics/ raw/master/_build/latex/BayesianStats.pdf <https://github.com/avrilcoghlan/LittleBookofRBayesianStatistics/raw/master/_build/latex/BayesianStats.pdf>`_.

Using Bayesian Analysis to Estimate a Proportion
------------------------------------------------

Bayesian analysis can be useful for estimating a proportion, when you have some rough
idea of what the value of the proportion is, but have relatively little data.

Specifying a Prior for a Proportion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An appropriate prior to use for a proportion is a Beta prior.

For example, if you want to estimate the proportion of people like chocolate, you
might have a rough idea that the most likely value is around 0.85, but that the proportion
is unlikely to be smaller than 0.60 or bigger than 0.95. 

You can find the best Beta prior to use in this case by specifying that the median (50\% percentile)
of the prior is 0.85, that the 99.999\% percentile is 0.95, and that the 0.001\% percentile is 0.60:

.. highlight:: r

::

    > quantile1 <- list(p=0.5, x=0.85)    # we believe the median of the prior is 0.85
    > quantile2 <- list(p=0.99999,x=0.95) # we believe the 99.999th percentile of the prior is 0.95
    > quantile3 <- list(p=0.00001,x=0.60) # we believe the 0.001st percentile of the prior is 0.60

We can then use the findBeta() function below to find the most appropriate Beta prior to use.

::

    > findBeta <- function(quantile1,quantile2,quantile3)
      {
         # find the quantiles specified by quantile1 and quantile2 and quantile3
         quantile1_p <- quantile1[[1]]; quantile1_q <- quantile1[[2]]
         quantile2_p <- quantile2[[1]]; quantile2_q <- quantile2[[2]]
         quantile3_p <- quantile3[[1]]; quantile3_q <- quantile3[[2]]

         # find the beta prior using quantile1 and quantile2
         priorA <- beta.select(quantile1,quantile2)
         priorA_a <- priorA[1]; priorA_b <- priorA[2]

         # find the beta prior using quantile1 and quantile3
         priorB <- beta.select(quantile1,quantile3)
         priorB_a <- priorB[1]; priorB_b <- priorB[2]

         # find the best possible beta prior
         diff_a <- abs(priorA_a - priorB_a); diff_b <- abs(priorB_b - priorB_b)
         step_a <- diff_a / 100; step_b <- diff_b / 100
         if (priorA_a < priorB_a) { start_a <- priorA_a; end_a <- priorB_a }
         else                     { start_a <- priorB_a; end_a <- priorA_a }
         if (priorA_b < priorB_b) { start_b <- priorA_b; end_b <- priorB_b }
         else                     { start_b <- priorB_b; end_b <- priorA_b }
         steps_a <- seq(from=start_a, to=end_a, length.out=1000)
         steps_b <- seq(from=start_b, to=end_b, length.out=1000)
         max_error <- 10000000000000000000
         best_a <- 0; best_b <- 0
         for (a in steps_a) 
         {
            for (b in steps_b) 
            {
               # priorC is beta(a,b)
               # find the quantile1_q, quantile2_q, quantile3_q quantiles of priorC: 
               priorC_q1 <- qbeta(c(quantile1_p), a, b)
               priorC_q2 <- qbeta(c(quantile2_p), a, b)
               priorC_q3 <- qbeta(c(quantile3_p), a, b)
               priorC_error <- abs(priorC_q1-quantile1_q) + 
                               abs(priorC_q2-quantile2_q) + 
                               abs(priorC_q3-quantile3_q)
               if (priorC_error < max_error)
               {
                 max_error <- priorC_error; best_a <- a; best_b <- b
               }
           } 
        }
        print(paste("The best beta prior has a=",best_a,"b=",best_b))
      }

To use the findBeta() function, you first need to copy and paste it into R.
The findBeta() function makes use of the beta.select() function from the LearnBayes
R package, so you first need to install the LearnBayes package
(for instructions on how to install an R package, see `How to install an R package 
<./installr.html#how-to-install-an-r-package>`_). 

You can then load the LearnBayes package, and use findBeta() to find the best
Beta prior for a proportion. For example, to find the best Beta prior for the
proportion of individuals who like chocolate, where you believe the most likely
value of the proportion is 0.85, and the value is almost definitely between 0.60 and 0.95, you can
type:

::

    > library("LearnBayes")
    > findBeta(quantile1,quantile2,quantile3)
      [1] "The best beta prior has a= 52.22 b= 9.52105105105105"
     
This tells us that the most appropriate prior to use for the proportion of
individuals who like chocolate is a Beta prior with a=52.22 and b=9.52, that is,
a Beta(52.22, 9.52) prior.

We can plot the prior density by using the "curve" function:

::

    > curve(dbeta(x,52.22,9.52105105105105)) # plot the prior

|image1|

Note that in the command above we use the "dbeta()" function to specify that
the density of a Beta(52.22,9.52105105105105) distribution. 

We can see from the picture of the density for a Beta(52.22,9.52105105105105) distribution
that it represents our prior beliefs about the proportion of people who like chocolate
fairly well, as the peak of the distribution is at about 0.85, and the density lies
almost entirely between about 0.68 and 0.97. 

.. Examples:
.. page 25 of OU book, 
.. quantile1 <- list(p=0.5, x=0.40) 
.. quantile2 <- list(p=0.99999, x=0.9)
.. quantile3 <- list(p=0.00001, x=0.05)
.. findBeta(quantile1,quantile2,quantile3)
.. "The best beta prior has a= 5.14 b= 7.54514514514515" 
.. curve(dbeta(x,5.14,7.545)) # plot the prior 

Calculating the Likelihood Function for a Proportion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Say you want to estimate a proportion, and you have a small data set that you can use for this
purpose. For example, if you want to estimate the proportion of people who like chocolate, you
may have carried out a survey of 50 people, and found that 45 say that they like chocolate.

This small data set can be used to calculate the conditional p.m.f. (probability mass function)
of the proportion given the observed data. This is called the likelihood function. It represents
how likely the possible values of the proportion are, given the observed data. 

If you want to estimate a proportion, and have a small data set, you can calculate the likelihood
function for the proportion using the function calcLikelihoodForProportion() below:

::

    > calcLikelihoodForProportion <- function(successes, total)
      {
         curve(dbinom(successes,total,x)) # plot the likelihood
      } 

The function calcLikelihoodForProportion() takes two input arguments: the number of successes
observed in the sample (eg. the number of people who like chocolate in the sample), and the
total sample size.

You can see that the likelihood function is being calculated using the Binomial distribution
(using the R "dbinom()" function). That is, the likelihood function is the probability
mass function of a B(total,successes) distribution, that is, of a Binomial distribution where the
we observe "successes" successes out of a sample of "total" observations in total.

For example, if we did a survey of 50 people, and found that 45 say they like chocolate, then
our total sample size is 50 and we have 45 "successes". We can calculate the likelihood
function for the proportion of people who like chocolate by typing:

::

    > calcLikelihoodForProportion(45, 50)

|image2|

You can see that the peak of the likelihood distribution is at 0.9, which is equal to the
sample mean (45/50 = 0.9). In other words, the most likely value of the proportion, given the
observed data, is 0.9. 

.. For example, Example 3.6, page 29 of OU book:
.. calcLikelihoodForProportion(11,50)
.. 
.. Note: curve(dbeta(x, (successes + 1), (total - successes + 1))) gives the same
.. shaped curve but not with the same heights. Why is this? xxx

Calculating the Posterior Distribution for a Proportion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Say you are trying to estimate a proportion, and have a prior distribution representing
your beliefs about the value of that proportion. If you have collected some data, you
can also calculate the likelihood function for the proportion given the data. 

However, after observing the data, you may wish to update the prior distribution for
the proportion, taking the data into consideration. That is, you may wish to calculate
the conditional distribution of the proportion given the data and the prior. This is is called
the posterior distribution for the proportion. 

The posterior distribution ssummarises what is known about the proportion after the data
has been observed, and combines the information from the prior and the data.

In our example of estimating the proportion of people who like chocolate, we have a Beta(52.22,9.52) prior
distribution (see above), and have some data from a survey in which we found that 45 out of 50 people like
chocolate. We can calculate the posterior distribution for the proportion given the prior and data using
the calcPosteriorForProportion() function below (which I adapted from "triplot" in the LearnBayes
package):

::

    > calcPosteriorForProportion <- function(successes, total, a, b)
      {
         # Adapted from triplot() in the LearnBayes package
         # Plot the prior, likelihood and posterior:
         likelihood_a = successes + 1; likelihood_b = total - successes + 1
         posterior_a = a + successes;  posterior_b = b + total - successes
         theta = seq(0.005, 0.995, length = 500)
         prior = dbeta(theta, a, b)
         likelihood = dbeta(theta, likelihood_a, likelihood_b)
         posterior  = dbeta(theta, posterior_a, posterior_b)
         m = max(c(prior, likelihood, posterior))
         plot(theta, posterior, type = "l", ylab = "Density", lty = 2, lwd = 3, 
              main = paste("beta(", a, ",", b, ") prior, B(", total, ",", successes, ") data,",
              "beta(", posterior_a, ",", posterior_b, ") posterior"), ylim = c(0, m), col = "red")
         lines(theta, likelihood, lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
         lines(theta, prior, lty = 3, lwd = 3, col = "green")
         legend(x=0.8,y=m, c("Prior", "Likelihood", "Posterior"), lty = c(3, 1, 2), 
              lwd = c(3, 3, 3), col = c("green", "blue", "red"))
         # Print out summary statistics for the prior, likelihood and posterior:
         calcBetaMode <- function(aa, bb) { BetaMode <- (aa - 1)/(aa + bb - 2); return(BetaMode); }
         calcBetaMean <- function(aa, bb) { BetaMean <- (aa)/(aa + bb); return(BetaMean); } 
         calcBetaSd   <- function(aa, bb) { BetaSd <- sqrt((aa * bb)/(((aa + bb)^2) * (aa + bb + 1))); return(BetaSd); }
         prior_mode      <- calcBetaMode(a, b)
         likelihood_mode <- calcBetaMode(likelihood_a, likelihood_b)
         posterior_mode  <- calcBetaMode(posterior_a, posterior_b)
         prior_mean      <- calcBetaMean(a, b)
         likelihood_mean <- calcBetaMean(likelihood_a, likelihood_b)
         posterior_mean  <- calcBetaMean(posterior_a, posterior_b)
         prior_sd        <- calcBetaSd(a, b)
         likelihood_sd   <- calcBetaSd(likelihood_a, likelihood_b)
         posterior_sd    <- calcBetaSd(posterior_a, posterior_b)
         print(paste("mode for prior=",prior_mode,", for likelihood=",likelihood_mode,", for posterior=",posterior_mode))
         print(paste("mean for prior=",prior_mean,", for likelihood=",likelihood_mean,", for posterior=",posterior_mean))
         print(paste("sd for prior=",prior_sd,", for likelihood=",likelihood_sd,", for posterior=",posterior_sd))
      }  

.. For example, Example 3.7, page 32 of OU book:
.. calcPosteriorForProportion(11,50,5.14,7.545)

To use the "calcPosteriorForProportion()" function, you will first need to copy and paste it into R.
It takes four arguments: the number of successes and total sample size in your data set, and the 
a and b values for your Beta prior. 

For example, to estimate the proportion of people who like chocolate, you had a Beta(52.22,9.52) prior
and had observed in a survey that 45 out of 50 people like chocolate. Therefore, the number of successes
is 45, the sample size is 50, and a and b for the prior are 52.22 and 9.52 respectively. Therefore, we
can calculate the posterior for the proportion of people who like chocolate, given the data and prior, by typing:

::

    > calcPosteriorForProportion(45, 50, 52.22, 9.52)
      [1] "mode for prior= 0.857381988617342 , for likelihood= 0.9 , for posterior= 0.876799708401677"
      [1] "mean for prior= 0.845804988662132 , for likelihood= 0.884615384615385 , for posterior= 0.870055485949526"
      [1] "sd for prior= 0.0455929848904483 , for likelihood= 0.0438847130123102 , for posterior= 0.0316674748482802"

|image4|

Since the prior and posterior are distributions, the area under their densities is 1.
The likelihood has been scaled so that the area underneath it is also 1, so that it is
easy to compare the likelihood with the prior and posterior.

Therefore, the prior and likelihood curves should look the same shape as those plotted
before (see above), but the y-axis scale is different for the likelihood scale compared
to the plot made using calcLikelihoodForProportion() above.

Note that the peak of the posterior always lies somewhere between the peaks of the prior and the 
likelihood, because it combines information from the prior and the likelihood (which is based on the data). 

In our example of estimating the proportion of people who like chocolate, 
the peak of the posterior is roughly half-way between the peaks of the likelihood and prior,
indicating that the prior and the data contribute roughly equally to the posterior.
